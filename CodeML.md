# CodeML

CodeML is an XML application for describing program code and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of CodeML is to enable program code to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for text.

CodeML is inspired by the [MathML](http://w3.org/Math/) and [OpenMath](http://www.openmath.org) formats for markup of mathematical formulae and can be used in conjuction with these formats in a variety of document formats.
