# OMDoc 1.3

OMDoc1.3 is an incremental extension of OMDoc1.2 that addresses immediate needs from the [OMDoc applications](../toolsprojects) that have been the focus of development in the last years.
 
## Changes to OMDoc1.2
 
In a nutshell, we have the following changes now (see a [report:11 full list of what is under discussion]; the [OMDoc1.3 Draft Specification](http://www.omdoc.org/pubs/omdoc1.3draft.pdf) already documents some of them).  
 
* OMDoc1.3 uses the namespace ```http://omdoc.org/ns```
* we have a completely revamped presentation system (see #1616) 
* a new syntax for structure sharing and referencing (see #1624) 
* a new metadata framework (see #1625) 
* corresponding metadata ontolgoies (see #1626)
