# OMDoc 2.0

OMDoc2.0 is the target of a radical redesigned and simplification of the OMDoc format. We will try to fix all the design flaws of OMDoc Version 1 without regards for backwards compatibility. 

We will approach OMDoc1.6 in a series of steps

* [OMDoc1.6.6](../OMDoc1) will introduce the pragmatic/strict design to OMDoc, work on this has already begun. 
* [OMDoc1.7](../OMDoc1.7) will be a bug-fix release 
* [OMDoc1.8](../OMDoc1.8) 
* [OMDoc1.9](../OMDoc1.9) will be the release candidate for OMDoc2.0.
