OMDoc2.0 is the target of a radical redesigned and simplification of the OMDoc format. We will try to fix all the design flaws of OMDoc Version 1 without regards for backwards compatibility. 

We will approach OMDoc1.6 in a series of steps

 

- [wiki:OMDoc1.6] will introduce the pragmatic/strict design to OMDoc, work on this has already begun. 
- [wiki:OMDoc1.7] will be a bug-fix release 
- [wiki:OMDoc1.8] 
- [wiki:OMDoc1.9] will be the release candidate for OMDoc2.0.
