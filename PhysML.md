# PhysML

PhysML is a content markup language for physics realized by extending the [OMDoc]("http://www.omdoc.org") format by an infrastructure for the principal concepts of physics: 'observables', physical 'systems', and 'experiments'. The formalization of the description of physics observables follows the structural essence of the operational theory of physics measurements. The representational infrastructure for systems and experiments allow to capture the distinctive practice of physics: natural laws are supported by evidence from experiments which are described, disseminated and reproduced by others.
