title: OMDoc 1.1 Release Candidate
---
 I have put the DTD and the omdoc manual in the final resting place, and changed the CVS sources to the OMDoc 1.1 tree. Everything you see [here](https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/) is relative to Version 1.1 now.

Please comment on the specification and the DTD until December 19, I will release OMDoc version 1.1 on December 21. 2001 (merry christmas).
