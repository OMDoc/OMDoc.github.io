title: OMDoc Version 1.1 has been released
---
This version is	mainly a bug-fix release that has become necessary by the experiments of encoding legacy material and theorem prover interfaces in OMDoc.  The changes are relatively minor, mostly adding optional fields. Version 1.1 of OMDoc freezes the development so that version 2.0 can be started off.
	
In contrast to the OMDoc format which has not changed much, the manual is a total re-write, it closes many documentation gaps, clarifies various remaining issues. and adds a multitude of new examples.
