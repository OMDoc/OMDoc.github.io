title: OMDoc-1.2 branch cut
---
We have cut a 
[subversion branch](https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/) for OMDoc version 1.2. It can be checked out with the URL
https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/ via the
subversion client.

The purpose of this branch is to maintain the OMDoc 1.2 specification and resources. There will not be any more development of the OMDoc format on this branch though errata and bug fixes will be maintained.

Projects that develop towards OMDoc-1.2 should work on this branch.
Since trunk development is currently on hold for project planning, we expect most development to take place on the omdoc-1.2 branch.
