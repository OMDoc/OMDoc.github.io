title: OMDoc-1.2 released
---
We have released the OMDoc 1.2 format.

After more than 4 years of development, his fixes a new version of the OMDoc format, and provides a stable API for developers.

This version of OMDoc introduces numerous tweaks in the OMDoc data model and syntax without changing the overall format.

For a while now OMDoc development will continue on the `omdoc1.2` branch until tools and resources have stabilized. All developers should change over to the branch.
