title: OMDoc-1.2 Errata Process
---
As with any release, the release of the OMDoc 1.2 specification will bring wider use and this flush out bugs that went unnoticed.  These bugs (called errata for	paper documents) are tracked in an errata document at https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/doc/spec/errata.pdf.
