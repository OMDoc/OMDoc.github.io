title: Call for Module Maintainers
---
We will restart development on the OMDoc format with the goal of reaching Version 2.0.  To make the format more modular, speed up the development process and share the burden, we will have module maintainers who drive the development process in close cooperation with the OMDoc project leader.

Please nominate yourself or others by e-mail to the developers mailing list.
