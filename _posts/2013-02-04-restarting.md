title: Restarting Work OMDoc
---
After a long time of exploring OMDoc applications and redeveloping the formal core of OMDoc as MMT, we have restarted the development of the second version of the OMDoc representation format. The development has re-started with a string of blue notes available at [https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/doc/blue]. These notes are still in an early stage, but give a glimbse at the direction we will take in the next months.
