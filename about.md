# OMDoc: Open Mathematical Documents

OMDoc is a markup format and data model for Open Mathematical Documents.

OMDoc serves as semantics-oriented representation format and ontology language for
mathematical knowledge. [Format](../format), [Distribution](../distribution), [Examples](../examples)

The current stable version is [OMDoc1.2](../OMDoc1.2) (see the
[OMDoc1.2 Book](../pubs/omdoc1.2.pdf). Current development work mainly focuses on OMDoc
applications, but the experiences gained there flows back into the OMDoc
Specifications. We are currently working on two fronts:

* [OMDoc1.3](../OMDoc1.3) is an incremental extension of OMDoc1.2 that addresses immediate needs from the
applications and increases semantic web compatibility.
* [OMDoc1.6](../OMDoc.16) is the first step towards [OMDoc2.0](../OMDoc2.0), this includes radical redesign.

OMDoc.org serves as a community portal for the OMDoc community and as a clearinghouse for information about OMDoc-based projects and extensions to other sciences. OMDoc bibliography, [OMDoc Tools and Projects](../toolsprojects)
