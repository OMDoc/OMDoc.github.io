# The OMDoc Distribution

The OMDoc distribution is a versioned set of language resources. There is one OMDoc distribution per released and upcoming version. The current released OMDoc distribution is [OMDoc1.2](http://github.com/OMDoc/omdoc-1.2).

The primary means of getting OMDoc distribution (and keeping up with it) is via the [OMDoc Grup at GitHub](https://github.com/OMDoc), which supplies the released distributions [OMDoc1.0](http://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.0), [OMDoc1.1](http://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.1), [OMDoc1.2](http://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.2) as release branches and the distribution for the upcoming [OMDoc1.6](http://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc) as the trunk. In the future we may have preview distributions for future releases as further repository branches. 

The OMDoc distribution provides
* A collection of [documents](https://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.2/tree/master/doc) about OMDoc, most notably the [OMDoc Specification](http://omdoc.org/pubs/omdoc1.2.pdf) 
* A set of [examples](https://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.2/tree/master/examples) 
* The [OMDoc Document Type Definition](https://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.2/tree/master/dtd) (DTD) and the [OMDoc RelaxNG Schema](https://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.2/tree/master/rnc) (RNC). Details about Schema and DTD validation can be found [here](../validation). 
* The [OMDoc System Ontology](https://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.2/tree/master/owl), an OWL-based ontology of OMDoc entities and their relations. 
* A set of [XSLT style sheets](https://github.com/OMDoc/OMDoc-1.2/tree/master/xsl) for presenting OMDoc documents for human consumption or as input for machines ... [more](../XSLT).
