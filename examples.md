# OMDoc Examples

## A set of OMDoc Documents  that tries to use all available elements
 
[all.omdoc](http://github.com/OMDoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/examples/usesall/all.omdoc"), [poset.omdoc](http://github.com/OMDoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/examples/usesall/poset.omdoc").  
This set of interconnecting documents is intended as a stand-alone torture test for OMDoc tools (unfortunately, it is still incomplete in coverage).

## Examples generated from other formats
 
* [OpenMath CDs](http://github.com/OMDoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/examples/omstd"): OMDoc generated from the OpenMath [wiki:CDs Content Dictionaries] 
* [PVS Prelude](http://github.com/OMDoc/branches/projects/pvs/prelude/"): The prelude (theories preloaded by default) in the [PVS](http://pvs.csl.sri.com) specification and verification system. 
* [ActiveMath](http://www.activemath.org): A computer-supported learning system based on OMDoc presentation.
