title: OMDoc Format
---
OMDoc is a markup format and data model for Open Mathematical Documents. It serves as semantics-oriented representation format and ontology language for mathematical knowledge.

 
Multi-level Content Markup
---
 
OMDoc differs from the presentation-based approaches surveyed in this status report on [Math on the Web]("http://www.mathtype.com/webmath/status/default.stm") in that it concentrates on representing the meaning of mathematical formulae instead of their appearance. OMDoc is an extension of the [OpenMath]("http://www.openmath.org") and  [MathML]("http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/"). It extends these formats by markup for the document, statement and theory level of mathematical documents, so that the document author can specify them and the consumer (an OMDoc reader or a mathematical software system) can take advantage of them.

This allows to develop semantics-based added-value services for displaying and manipulating mathematical formulae and structured documents. [wiki:ToolsProjects more]

 
Design Goals: the OMDoc format aims to
---
 


1. be 'ntologically uncommitted' (like the [OpenMath]("http://www.openmath.org") format), so that it can serve as an 'integration format' for mathematical software systems. 
2. provide a representation format for 'mathematical documents' that combine 'formal' and 'informal' views of all the 'mathematical knowledge' contained in them. 
3. be based on 'sound logic/representational principles' (as not to embarrass the author in front of his colleagues from automated reasoning) 
4. be based on 'structural/content markup' to guarantee both 1. and 2. To ensure manageability of the format OMDoc is a [wiki:Modules modular format] to allow language subsetting, embedding and [wiki:extensions extensions]. 

 
Status & History
---
 
The current stable version of the OMDoc format is [wiki:Distribution OMDoc1.2] which was released in December 2001 and is considered the mature state of OMDoc 1. [wiki:history History]

Work on OMDoc Version 2 has started. [wiki:Development more]
