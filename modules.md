OMDoc is an XML application, organized into ten modules,

| MOBJ | Math Objects | Mathematical Formulae in [OpenMath]("http://www.openmath.org"), [MathML]("http://www.w3.org/Math/") or legacy formats.|
| DC | Dublin Core Metadata | in [Dublin Core]("http://www.dublincore.org") |
| CC | Creative Commons  Metadata | licensing metadata in [CC]("http://www.creativecommons.org") format |
| ST | Statements | i.e.  Definitions, Theorems, Axioms, Examples, etc, and simple theories with inheritance|
| PF | Proofs | as proof objects or structured proofs from hypotheses |
| ADT | Abstract Data Types |  for structured definition of inductively defined sets |
| CTH | Complex Theories | To add inheritance via translations, theory inclusions. |
| DG | Development Graphs | An infrastructure for the management of theory change. |
| PRES | Presentation | OMDoc allows the user to specify  notations for content mathematical objects. |
| EXT | Web Extensions | to be able to specify applets, private (non-XML) data, etc. |
| QUIZ | Exercises/Quiz | to make OMDoc a viable format for educational and course materials |
