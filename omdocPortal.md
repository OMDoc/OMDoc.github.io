The Trac Source Code and Project Management for OMDoc
---
 
The OMDoc portal uses the [Trac]("http://trac.edgewall.org") sytem for integrated Source Code and Project Management to aid the development of software hosted here.  Trac is a server-based discussion forum and bug tracking system. We use it to track, archive and discuss tasks, software bugs, and enhancements in our project. Discussions are centered about threads called "Tickets" (which need not be software bugs at all), which are numbered, can be searched, and can be referred to by their URL.

Using our Trac instance is very simple, just play around with the web interface (there are many things you can do without being logged in). We value your feedback, so feel free to [submit a ticket]("https://trac.omdoc.org/OMDoc/newticket")
