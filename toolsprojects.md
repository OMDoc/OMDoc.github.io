title: OMDoc Tools and Projects
---
A representation format is only as good as the respective tools and systems are. Therefore tool development will be the main concern in the next future. 

## General XML tools for OMDoc

* [DTD and Schema-based Validation](../validation) 
* the [TNTBase](http://tntbase.mathweb.org) system, a versioned XML database witt OMDoc support, it can be used to store, query and reference mathematical documents represented in OMDoc. 

## OMDoc Libraries

* The main development platform is [jomdoc:WikiStart JOMDoc] (a Java-based OMDoc library). 
* [mmt:WikiStart FLOMDoc] is an experimental library in SCALA. 

## Tools to support the management and creation of OMDocs

* the semantic wiki [SWiM](http://kwarc.info/projects/swim/) for editing, browsing, and discussing OMDoc 
* the [CPoint](http://kwarc.info/projects/CPoint/) system, allows to annotate M$ PowerPoint slides and export OMDoc 
* The [ActiveMath Project](http://www.activemath.org) has provided some [authoring tools](http://www.activemath.org/~paul/AuthoringComments) as well. 
* The [sTeX](http://kwarc.info/projects/stex) system is a semantic extension of TeX/LaTeX that supports translation into OMDoc. 
* and a bunch of [XSL style files](../XSLT) to present OMDoc to the user (part of the above-mentioned JOMDoc) and transform it into input formats of various mathematical software systems. 

 
## Projects that that endorse OMDoc (see also the systems below)

* [ActiveMath](http://www.activemath.org) (Math Learning on the    Web) 
* [Course Capsules](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ccaps/) (Content based course delivery at Carnegie Mellon) 
* [OMEGA](http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/OMEGA) (a mathematical assistant) 
 
## Systems that speak OMDoc (varying degrees of fluency)

* LambdaClam (an inductive theorem prover) 
* [INKA](http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/InKa/) (another inductive theorem prover) 
* [TPS](http://gtps.math.cmu.edu/tps.html) (a higher-order theorem prover) 
* [OMEGA](http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/OMEGA) (a mathematical assistant) 
* [VeriFun](http://http://verifun.org) (a verifier for functional programs) 

 
## OMDoc Interfaces for Existing Systems

* an [Interface](https://github.com/OMDoc/projects/pvs/doc/) to the [PVS](http://pvs.csl.sri.com) system. 
* an [Interface](https://github.com/OMDoc/projects/helm/doc/) to the [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr) theorem prover via the [HELM](http://helm.cs.unibo.it) XML interface. 
* an [Interface](https://github.com/OMDoc/projects/aldor/doc/) for the [Aldor](http://www.aldor.org/) programming language (only developed for OMDoc 1.1).
