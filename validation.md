# OMDoc Validation

OMDoc is an XML vocabulary, which basically means that OMDocs must be valid [XML](http://www.w3c.org/XML) (i.e. have a balanced set of element tags).

The set of OMDoc valid documents is determined by the [OMDoc Specification](https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/doc/spec/spec.pdf).  Certain syntactical aspects can be checked by validating documents with the [OMDoc document type definition](https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/dtd/).

The XML community has recently standardized a more expressive approach to specifying well-formed XML documents: [RelaxNG](http://www.relaxng.org): The [OMDoc RelaxNG Schema](https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/branches/omdoc-1.2/dtd/) is currently the best validation resource
